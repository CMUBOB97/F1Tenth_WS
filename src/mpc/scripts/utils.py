    Return the nearest point along the given piecewise linear trajectory.
    Args:
        point (numpy.ndarray, (2, )): (x, y) of current pose
        trajectory (numpy.ndarray, (N, 2)): array of (x, y) trajectory waypoints
            NOTE: points in trajectory must be unique. If they are not unique, a divide by 0 error will destroy the world
    Returns:
        nearest_point (numpy.ndarray, (2, )): nearest point on the trajectory to the point
        nearest_dist (float): distance to the nearest point
        t (float): nearest point's location as a segment between 0 and 1 on the vector formed by the closest two points on the trajectory. (p_i---*-------p_i+1)
        i (int): index of nearest point in the array of trajectory waypoints
